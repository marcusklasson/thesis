\chapter{Acknowledgments}
\label{chap:acknowledgements}

\noindent First and foremost, I want to thank my supervisors Hedvig Kjellström and Cheng Zhang who gave me the opportunity to pursue PhD studies. Hedvig, I admire your constant support and encouragement, as well as your willingness to make everyone feel welcome around you. Cheng, I am forever grateful for every time you pulled out of rabbit holes, patching me up, and strengthening my self-confidence. You have motivated me to always do my best and taking steps forward to become a better researcher. 
Along this line, I want to express my deepest gratitude to Patric Jensfelt for expanding my mind with motivating my research with challenges in the real-world. Furthermore, I want to thank Henrik Götesson from The Swedish Association of the Visually Impaired (SRF) for enlightening me of the importance of involving the real target users in the development process of new technology. 
\newline 


\noindent Before moving to Stockholm, I want to thank Stefan Adalbjörnsson, S{\o}ren Vang Andersen, and Andreas Jakobsson in the first place who were the ones encouraging me to pursue a PhD while I was writing my Master's thesis in Lund. I also want to thank Filip Elvander for sharing his experiences while visiting Stockholm. 
Finally, I want to thank my fellow Da Vinci PhD students Gabrielle Flood and Lea Versbach. I am so glad that we have stayed in touch and could share experiences from our academic journeys. Thank you for all the advice on thesis writing.

\noindent Although the studies have been an emotional roller coaster, I must admit that the divison of Robotics, Perception, and Learning (RPL) has been an amazing workplace. I have met many people across the academic hierarchy as a student, teaching assistant, and colleague. Firstly, I want tot hank my mentor Iolanda Leite for all the advice to make me more at peace with myself during the studies. As a teaching assistant, I have taken part in very interesting courses with hope to inspire Master students. Mårten Björkman, thank you for all the tools and insights on teaching that you have provided with, you have indeed motivated me to search for opportunities where I get to inspire students to learn more about computer vision. John Folkesson, thank you for letting me help shaping your course on probabilistic graphical models and for always considering the suggestions from the teaching assistants. Additionally, I want to thank Christian Smith for all the thoughtful brainteaser questions at the \%-seminars, and Hossein Azizpour and Josephine Sullivan for changing my mindset on the possibilities of deep learning. Finally, I want to thank the RPL GPU cluster team of Joonatan Määntäri, Vladimir Li, Federico Baldassarre, Matteo Gamba, Yonk Shi, because my research would not have been possible without you.  
\newline 

\noindent I want to thank my research group with Sofia Broomé, Ruibo Tu, Taras Kucherenko, Olga Mikheeva, Ci Li, Benjamin Christoffersen, and Vincent Trichon, for maintaining a supportive environment with constructive feedback, fruitful discussions, and relaxing social activities in- and outside the office. Especially, I want to dedicate an extra amount of gratitude to Sofia for all the conversations that have often given me insights in how I can express myself more clearly, and Ruibo, for his kindness and advice on how to conduct valuable research.   
Moreover, I am thankful to P\"{u}ren  G\"{u}ler, Judith B\"{u}tepage, Xi Chen, Alexis Linard, Georg Schuppe, and Daniel Sim\~{o}es Marta for being such great roommates. 
It has been great to follow the progress of Jesper Karlsson, Pouria Tajvar, Fernando dos Santos Barbosa, Irmak Do\u{g}an, Sanne van Waveren, and Sarah Gillet, which I have experienced two moves at the KTH Campus together. At the final office stop, Lindstedtsvägen 24, I have joy to get to know Grace Hung, Alex Sleat, Ioanna Mitsioni, Ilaria Torre, Katie Winkle, Wei Wang, Marta Romeo, Chris Sprague, Matti Vahs, Mart Kartasev, Teresa Parreira, Fereidoon Zangeneh, Arzu Guneysu Ozgur, Bastian, Gaspar, and José. Although the past years have been challenging, all laughs I have had with you have made me endure this, thank you.
