\noindent \textit{Hedvig Kjellström}, thank you for your constant support and encouragement during these years. I admire your enthusiasm and curiosity for new research and your willingness to make everyone feel welcome, which is an air that I will bring with me in my future career. 
\newline 

\noindent \textit{Cheng Zhang}, thank you for never giving up on me. Thank you for the tough love, for every time you pulled me out of rabbit holes, and for strengthening my confidence. You inspire me to continue pursuing research, and I am forever grateful that you wanted to be my co-supervisor. 
\newline

\noindent \textit{Patric Jensfelt}, I would have never come this far if it were not for you. Thank you for expanding my mind with thinking about real-world challenges when motivating my research. I look forward to when you want to cash out the pasta carbonara from Bullens that I owe you.
