\label{chap:acknowledgements}

\noindent First and foremost, I want to thank my supervisors Hedvig Kjellström and Cheng Zhang who gave me the opportunity to pursue PhD studies. Hedvig, I admire your constant support and encouragement, as well as your willingness to make everyone feel welcome around you. Cheng, I am forever grateful for every time you pulled out of rabbit holes, patching me up, and strengthening my self-confidence. You have motivated me to always do my best and taking steps forward to become a better researcher. 
Along this line, I want to express my deepest gratitude to Patric Jensfelt for expanding my mind with motivating my research with challenges in the real-world. Furthermore, I want to thank Henrik Götesson from The Swedish Association of the Visually Impaired (SRF) for enlightening me of the importance of involving the real target users in the development process of new technology.

\noindent Although the studies have been an emotional roller coaster, I must admit that the divison of Robotics, Perception, and Learning (RPL) has been an amazing workplace. I have met many people across the academic hierarchy as a student, teaching assistant, and colleague. Firstly, I want tot hank my mentor Iolanda Leite for all the advice to make me more at peace with myself during the studies. As a teaching assistant, I have taken part in very interesting courses with hope to inspire Master students. Mårten Björkman, thank you for all the tools and insights on teaching that you have provided with, you have indeed motivated me to search for opportunities where I get to inspire students to learn more about computer vision. John Folkesson, thank you for letting me help shaping your course on probabilistic graphical models and for always considering the suggestions from the teaching assistants. Additionally, I want to thank Christian Smith for all the thoughtful brainteaser questions at the \%-seminars, and Hossein Azizpour and Josephine Sullivan for changing my mindset on the possibilities of deep learning. Finally, I want to thank the RPL GPU cluster team of Joonatan Määntäri, Vladimir Li, Federico Baldassarre, Matteo Gamba, Yonk Shi, because my research would not have been possible without you.

\noindent I want to thank my research group with Sofia Broomé, Ruibo Tu, Taras Kucherenko, Olga Mikheeva, Ci Li, Benjamin Christoffersen, and Vincent Trichon, for maintaining a supportive environment with constructive feedback, fruitful discussions, and relaxing social activities in- and outside the office. Especially, I want to dedicate an extra amount of gratitude to Sofia for all the conversations that have often given me insights in how I can express myself more clearly, and Ruibo, for his kindness and advice on how to conduct valuable research.   
Moreover, I am thankful to P\"{u}ren  G\"{u}ler, Judith B\"{u}tepage, Xi Chen, Alexis Linard, Georg Schuppe, and Daniel Sim\~{o}es Marta for being such great roommates. 
It has been great to follow the progress of Jesper Karlsson, Pouria Tajvar, Fernando dos Santos Barbosa, Irmak Do\u{g}an, Sanne van Waveren, and Sarah Gillet, which I have experienced two moves at the KTH Campus together. At the final office stop, Lindstedtsvägen 24, I have joy to get to know Grace Hung, Alex Sleat, Ioanna Mitsioni, Ilaria Torre, Katie Winkle, Wei Wang, Marta Romeo, Chris Sprague, Matti Vahs, Mart Kartasev, Teresa Parreira, Fereidoon Zangeneh, Arzu Guneysu Ozgur, Bastian, Gaspar, and José. Although the past years have been challenging, all laughs I have had with you have made me endure this, thank you. 
Ciwan Ceylan and Ignacio Torroba Balmori for being so easy to talk with about life in general and all the laughs that have taken the edge off the seriousness in many situations to give me perspective. All of you mentioned above have made it easier for me to write this thesis. 
\newline 

\noindent To Christian Pek and Truls Nyberg, I am immensely grateful that I have been rewarded with friends like you two. Christian, you have been like a big brother for me, always being there to help me out with any issue and give me advice on how to take care of my work and myself. Truls, I am so happy that our paths finally collided after so many years close by each other, and that we can discuss and laugh about matters at work and our lives. 
\newline 

\noindent Outside KTH, I want to thank Stefan Adalbjörnsson, S{\o}ren Vang Andersen, and Andreas Jakobsson in the first place who were the ones encouraging me to pursue a PhD while I was writing my Master's thesis in Lund. I also want to thank Filip Elvander for sharing his experiences while visiting Stockholm. 
Finally, I want to thank my fellow Da Vinci PhD students Gabrielle Flood and Lea Versbach. I am so glad that we have stayed in touch and could share experiences from our academic journeys, thank you for all the advice on thesis writing. 
\newline 


\noindent I want to show my gratitude to my friends from my hometown Luleå and Lunds Tekniska Högskola, especially Jens, Nils, and William, for always being there for me regardless of how infrequently we meet. Samuel, I am so happy that our friendship was more than just being colleagues, and I am thankful for your honesty and sharing of your thoughts.   
\newline    

\noindent Finally, I want to thank my closest family. To my father, Hans, for reminding me that hard work pays off, and that I sometimes just have to bite the bullet. To my brother, Henrik, who have always encouraged me to walk towards places that I believe will make me happy, thank you for the tough love that makes me want to become a better person. To my mother, Ewa, for providing me with a stable ground to build my life on, thank you for motivating me to always do my best. To my dear Irene, thank you for being the solid rock that I can lean on in both bright and dark times. In my worst moments, you are the one who makes me feel that everything will be fine in the end.
