    \caption{Test accuracy over the text description length $T$ for all SplitAE, VCCA, and VCCA-private models using the text description. We show the accuracy for the models trained with $T = 6, 8, 16, 24, 32, 36, 40, 50, 75$, and $91$ words. The results have been averaged for 10 different seeds and the error bars show the standard deviations for every setting of $T$. Abbreviations: SplitAE, Split Autoencoder; VCCA, Variational Canonical Correlation Analysis.}
