    \caption{Examples of decoded iconic images from VCCA$_{xiwy}$ with their corresponding natural image and true iconic image as well as predicted labels and image similarity metrics. The column Classification shows the true label for the natural image (True Label) and the label predicted by the model (Pred. Label). Abbreviations: VCCA, Variational Canonical Correlation Analysis; PSNR, Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio; SSIM, Structural Similarity; KL, Kullback-Leibler Divergence; Arla Eco. Sourcream, Arla Ecological Sourcream; Arla Std. Milk, Arla Standard Milk.}
