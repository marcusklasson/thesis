  \caption{Average test accuracies over tasks after learning the final task (ACC) over different replay memory sizes $M$ for the RS-MCTS (Ours) and the Random, ETS, and Heuristic baselines on all datasets.
  All results have been averaged over 5 seeds. The results show that replay scheduling can outperform replaying with random and ETS schedules, %equal task proportions,
  especially for small $M$, on both small and large datasets across different backbone choices. Furthermore, our method requires less careful tuning than the Heuristic baseline as $M$ increases.
