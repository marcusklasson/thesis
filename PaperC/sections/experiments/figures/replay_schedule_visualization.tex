  \caption{ Replay schedule learned from Split CIFAR-100 visualized as a bubble plot. %Visualization using a bubble plot of a replay schedule learned from Split CIFAR-100. %The color of the circles corresponds to a historical task and its size represents the task proportion that is replayed. The memory size is $M=100$ and the results are from 1 seed. 
  The task proportions vary dynamically over time which would be hard to replace by a heuristic method.
