\noindent Replay-based continual learning have shown to be successful in mitigating catastrophic forgetting despite having limited access to historical data. However, storing historical data is cheap in many real-world applications, yet replaying all seen data would be prohibited due to processing time constraints. In such settings, we propose learning the time to learn for a continual learning system, in which we learn replay schedules over which tasks to replay at different time steps. To demonstrate the importance of learning the time to learn, we use Monte Carlo tree search in an ideal continual learning scenario to find the proper replay schedule. We perform extensive evaluations to show the benefits of replay scheduling in various memory settings and in combination with different replay methods. Moreover, the results indicate that the found schedules are consistent with human learning insights. Our findings opens up for new research directions that can bring current continual learning research closer to real-world needs.
