\label{chap:summary_of_included_papers}

\noindent 
In this chapter, we provide a summaries of the included paper for this thesis. Paper \ref{sec:paperA} and \ref{sec:paperB} are connected through the Grocery Store dataset where we present the work and then perform an ablation study over which modalities in the dataset that are useful for training classifiers. In Paper \ref{sec:paperC} and \ref{sec:paperD}, we focus on continual learning (CL) and present a new setting that aims to fill the gap between CL research and real-world problems as well as a method for doing so.
