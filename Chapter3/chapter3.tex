\chapter{Summary of Included Papers}
\label{chap:summary_of_included_papers}

\MK{This chapter could be about how each paper are connected to each other.
\begin{itemize}
	\item "if assistive vision app exists, how are my contributions required to have in the app?"
	\item Data is important
	\item Object recognition in the wild. Use of multiple "soft" labels to push representations of similar items closer to each other. 
	\item How to learn new classes?
\end{itemize}
This chapter could for example be called "Real-world object recognition".
}

\noindent 
%In this chapter, we provide a summaries of the included paper for this thesis. Paper \ref{sec:paperA} and \ref{sec:paperB} are connected through the Grocery Store dataset where we present the work and then perform an ablation study over which modalities in the dataset that are useful for training classifiers. In Paper \ref{sec:paperC} and \ref{sec:paperD}, we focus on continual learning (CL) and present a new setting that aims to fill the gap between CL research and real-world problems as well as a method for doing so.
