%% Write about Paper A and B in a coherent way

This chapter presents an approach for enhancing fine-grained classification performance of grocery items by using web-scraped information. We focus on classification of grocery items due to applicability in assistive vision and its potential to enhance the independence of visually impaired (VI) people [ADD groceries/shopping/object recognition for VI REFs]. Initially, we were interested in learning classifiers with natural images taken in the grocery stores combined with web-scraped information about the grocery items, such as iconic images and text descriptions from supermarket websites. Using iconic images have been used in grocery image classification earlier [ADD grocery paper REFs], however, utilizing text descriptions was as far we know absent for this application even if it has been successfully applied in other image classification problems [ADD REFs, Bujwid and Sullivan, AwA dataset, or other Attribute datasets]. Thus, we collected our own dataset of grocery items images using a mobile phone camera as well as web-scraped images and text descriptions to study whether this multi-view approaches would benefit training the classifiers (Section 2). We then select a multi-view learning framework based on the Variational Autoender (VAE) for investigating how the different data views affect the fine-grained classification performance (Section 3).

\noindent 
%In this chapter, we provide a summaries of the included paper for this thesis. Paper \ref{sec:paperA} and \ref{sec:paperB} are connected through the Grocery Store dataset where we present the work and then perform an ablation study over which modalities in the dataset that are useful for training classifiers. In Paper \ref{sec:paperC} and \ref{sec:paperD}, we focus on continual learning (CL) and present a new setting that aims to fill the gap between CL research and real-world problems as well as a method for doing so.
