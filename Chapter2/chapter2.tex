\chapter{Background}
\label{chap:background}

The goal with this chapter is to provide the reader with preliminaries that are useful for comprehending the included papers. We assume that the reader has some knowledge in calculus, linear algebra, and probability theory, but we intend to keep it on a basic level. First, we give the notation that will be used throughout the thesis. Then, we will introduce a selection of related works to place the thesis into context. 

\section{Notation and Terminology}\label{sec:notation}

We will begin by providing some algebraic notation that will be used for representing various types of data in the thesis. Scalars (both integer and real) are denoted by italic letters such as $a$. Vectors are denoted by lowercase bold italic letters such as $\vx$, where all vectors are assumed to be column vectors. A superscript $T$ denotes the transpose of a vector or matrix, such that $\vx^{T}$ becomes a row vector. Matrices are denoted as uppercase bold italic letters such as $\mW$. The notation $(w_1, \dots, w_m)$ denotes a row vector with $m$ elements, where the corresponding column vector is denoted as $(w_1, \dots, w_m)^{T}$. 

A dataset is denoted by the set $\gD = \{\vx^{(1)}, \dots, \vx^{(N)} \}$, where $\vx^{(i)}$ is the $i$-th example among the $N$ data points. Each data point is assumed to belong in a space of vectors denoted by $\gX$, such that $\vx \in \gX$. The data generating distribution is denoted by $p_{data}(\gX)$ which is usually unknown. To provide an example, we let the vector $\vx = (x_1, \dots, x_m)$ represent a flattened image of $m$ pixels. In this case, all possible images that can exist belong to the space $\gX$ and the data generating distribution $p_{data}(\gX)$ gives the probability of how likely each image is to occur in the world. In supervised learning, there is also a target, either denoted as $y^{(i)}$ or $\vy^{(i)}$, associated with $\vx^{(i)}$. The target belongs to the target space $\gY$, where the space is discrete $\gY = \{1, \dots, C\}$ for classification tasks over $C$ number of classes, or continuous $\gY = (-\infty, \infty)$ over an interval of real values for regression tasks. 

%Perhaps can skip spaces and use $\vy \in \{1, \dots, C\}$ to represent the labels and $\vx \in \mathbb{R}$, since I don't really use $\gX$ anywhere but in the RL part for state and action spaces but perhaps it's good to introduce the space notation then...

Throughout this thesis, we take a machine learning approach to solve tasks by tuning an adaptive model using a dataset called the \textit{training set}. In our case, we will represent the model with a function $f_{\vtheta}(\vx)$ that allows us to predict outcomes of events/data $\vx$ from the task of interest. The parameters $\vtheta$ expresses the function and we use machine learning algorithms for tuning parameters with the given dataset during the training phase. Once the model is trained, we often enter the \textit{test phase} where we want to evaluate the model by predicting outcomes on an unseen dataset called the \textit{test set}. The ability to predict outcomes of new data that is different from the examples seen during training is called \textit{generalization}, which is a central goal for most applications in machine learning and pattern recognition. 


\section{Problem Settings in Machine Learning}

Machine learning problems can be divided into three main fields, namely, \textit{supervised learning}, \textit{unsupervised learning}, and \textit{reinforcement learning} (RL). Since this thesis includes work from each of these problem settings, we will briefly introduce these topics to provide the reader with context on the tasks that we are trying to solve. 

\MK{TO-DO: Add references to papers and sections!}
\paragraph{Supervised Learning.} In this setting, we are given a dataset $\{(\vx^{(i)}, \vy^{(i)})\}_{i=1}^{N}$ where each data example $\vx^{(i)}$ is accompanied with a target $\vy^{(i)}$. The goal is to estimate a function $f_{\vtheta}(\vx)$ that assigns the correct target to each example in the training set as accurately as possible. In classification problems, each target belongs to one of $K$ discrete categories, such that $\vy = \{1, \dots, K\}$, and we want to predict which of the categories that new data belongs to. Classification tasks will be involved in all included papers of this thesis wherein Paper A and B we focus on assigning the correct product category to images of grocery items. Another problem type in supervised learning is regression where the targets are continuous and real-valued. An example of a regression task is to predict the outdoors temperature tomorrow given the observed temperature today. 

\paragraph{Unsupervised Learning.} Here, we are given a dataset $\{\vx^{(i)}\}_{i=1}^{N}$ without access to any corresponding targets. The goal in this unsupervised setting may then be to find hidden structures in the given dataset. For example, we might be interested in discovering groups of similar examples with \textit{clustering} techniques, or we may want to use \textit{density estimation} where we approximate the true data distribution $p_{data}$ with a parametric distribution $p_{\vtheta}$ using the collected dataset, or we may want to project high-dimensional data into two or three dimensions for \textit{visualization} purposes. We will get back to these goals when we introduce representation learning in Section X. 

\paragraph{Reinforcement Learning.} For these problems, we have a \textit{learning agent} that wants reach a goal in an environment by performing a given set of actions. After performing an action, the agent observes the state of the environment and receives a reward from the environment saying how good or bad the taken action was to reach the goal. The objective for the agent is to maximize the reward signal within the time the agent reaches the goal. The agent then has to learn a policy for deciding which actions to perform in certain situations in the environment. The policy $\pi_{\vtheta}(\va | \vs)$ is a mapping from perceived states $\vs$ in the environment to actions $\va$ that should maximize the reward signal. An example of a task that can be framed as a RL problem is the so called Mountain Car problem, where the agent is a car that is trying to drive up to the top of a hill. The state represents the position and velocity of the car and the agent must take actions that will move the car forward or backwards. The objective is to reach the goal with as little time as possible, and the agent is encouraged to do so by the environment by sending the agent a negative reward for every time step that passes without reaching the top of the hill. We will return to the RL framework later when we describe the prerequisites for Paper D. \vspace{1mm}

There exist many different methods for solving problems within these three fields. In this thesis, we employ deep learning methods which has been successfully applied in each field by representing the models with deep neural networks~\cite{he2016deep, bengio2013representation, mnih2015human}.

%that is trying to maximize a reward signal $r$ by performing a given set of actions in an environment to reach a specific goal. The agent observes the state of the environment 


%In this paradigm, we are concerned with decision-making where the goal is to take actions that maximize some reward. The decision-making is modeled by a policy which bases the action selection on observations that are collected by interacting with the task environment through the selected actions. One main challenge is how to handle the trade-off between exploration of different actions in new situations and exploitation by selecting actions where the agent already has experienced good reward signals. Furthermore, the reward signal can be received either in dense or sparse forms, where sparse rewards are typically more challenging to learn from and are less sample-efficient. 


\section{Deep Learning}

In this section, we give a brief overview of deep learning~\cite{goodfellow2016deep} which is the main building block for the models we use in this thesis. Deep learning contains a family of machine learning models based on neural networks that are parametric function approximators used for representing some function of interest. Much of the successes of deep learning methods have been in supervised learning settings, especially in applications where there are large amounts of labelled data and sufficiently large model in terms of number of parameters in the network. In the following sections, we will introduce the deep learning frameworks and models that we have used in this thesis.   

%For many applications, neural networks have been shown to  that are used for representing functions  are parametric function approximators. 

\subsection{Deep Neural Networks}

Neural networks is a class of machine learning models which popularity have grown immensely due to their ability to learn from large and high-dimensional datasets. Moreover, neural networks have been successfully applied in various number of fields in computer vision~\cite{he2016deep, krizhevsky2012imagenet}, natural language processing~\cite{devlin2018bert}, and reinforcement learning~\cite{mnih2015human, silver2016mastering}. These models are constructed by stacking layers of parameters that extract intermediate representations of the input data. The last layer outputs the target answer from the queried input and is specific for the task. For example, in image classification, the last layer outputs class scores representing which class the image is most likely to belong to. 

Next, we will describe three popular types of neural networks, namely, multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). \MK{TO-DO: It would be nice to have some simple illustrations of how the networks process the data, I can take inspiration from how other people have done it.}

\paragraph{Multilayer Perceptrons.} The simplest form of feedforward neural networks is the MLP. Let the vector $\vx = (x_1, \dots, x_d)^{T}$ be some form of data where $x_i$ is the $i$-th feature for $i = 1, \dots, d$. Every layer in the MLP constitutes of weights $\mW$ that are used for transforming the input such that the output reveals some hidden structure useful for solving the task of interest. The transformation is performed with a matrix multiplication, i.e., $\vh = \mW \vx$, to receive the intermediate representation $\vh$. An essential part for enabling neural networks to learn non-linear functions is to add an activation function right after the matrix multiplication of each layer. Otherwise, the neural network would only be capable of learning linear functions since the matrix multiplication is a linear mapping. A common activation function is the $a(\vx) = \max(0, \vx)$, or the so called Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation, which outputs $\vx$ when $\vx > 0$ or otherwise zero. By stacking two layers together in a neural network with a ReLU activation, we then obtain the representation $\vh = \mW_2\max(0,  \mW_1\vx)$. Note here that this representation could be predicted class scores, such that $\vh = \hat{\vy}$, if we would use two-layer MLP for a classication task. 

\paragraph{Convolutional Neural Networks.} For data where the spatial order of each feature can be salient for prediction tasks such as image classification, we need a network that can capture relationships between features. CNNs are special kinds of neural networks that can process data with grid-like structures. Convolutional layers constitutes of a set of filters with adaptable weight parameters. To produce the output, we slide each filter across the input across the width and height of the input and compute dot products between the filter weights and the input at any position. Each filter will then produce a 2-dimensional feature map that gives the responses of that filter at every spatial position. The 2-dimensional feature maps from all filters are then stacked depth-wise to obtain the output volume. The obtained feature maps are often downsampled along their spatial dimensions using a pooling operation after the activation function. The parameter sharing in convolutional layers where each weight in a filter is applied to every position of the input comes from the idea that if some visual features are important in one part of the image, it should intuitively be useful at some other location as well. Furthermore, this design choice also makes the model require fewer parameters and a lower number of operations to compute the outputs.

%Intuitively, the network will learn filters that activate when they see some type of visual feature such as edges in early layers, and eventually object parts in later layers that are discriminative . 

%Convolutional layers provide three important properties that can help the model, namely, sparse interactions, parameter sharing, and equivariant representations~\cite{goodfellow2016deep}. In MLPs, the matrix multiplication makes every output unit interact with every input unit. In contrast, CNNs typically establishes sparse interactions between the output and input by making the filter smaller than the input. This means that the model needs fewer parameters and fewer number of operations to compute the output. Furthermore, each weight is applied to every position of the input (except perhaps boundary pixels depending design choices of the layer) compared to in MLPs where a weight is multiplied with one element and never revisited.   

%An intuitive example is to detect edges in an image with pixels around local region rather than using pixels 

%Each filter operates on local regions of the input by computing the dot product between the weights and the local input region. The output is a feature map obtained by computing the dot product between the weights and the input by sliding the filter weights across the whole input.  same weights are slid across the whole input to obtain a feature map weights in a filter , where the dot product of the  

%, we The MLP operates on each input feature individually. Hence, the order of the features is ignored. However, in images, we know that pixels can have strong relationships between each other where, for instance, two neighboring pixels often have similar color and may belong to the same object that we wish to recognize. 


\paragraph{Recurrent Neural Networks.} RNNs are a family of neural network models specialized for processing sequences of data. Similar to CNNs, these models use parameter sharing by applying the same weights across several time steps. The parameter sharing is important in RNNs as it enables the model to handle different sequence lengths as well as being capable of recognizing relevant information that can appear at different locations in the sequence. Many RNNs follow the same procedure through the equation $\vh^{(t)} = f_{\vtheta}(\vh^{(t-1)}, \vx^{(t)})$, where the RNN produces the current state $\vh^{(t)}$ by incorporating the input data $\vx^{(t)}$ at time $t$ into the previous hidden state $\vh^{(t-1)}$. Hence, the hidden state $\vh^{(t)}$ will now contain information about the whole past sequence up to time $t$. In most applications, there will be an extra output layer that reads the information from state $\vh^{(t)}$ to make predictions. An example application for RNNs is predicting the next word in a sentence given previous words, where the RNN should store the necessary information about previous words to predict the rest of the sentence. A common choice of RNN model is the Long Short-Term Memory~\cite{hochreiter1997long} (LSTM) which mitigates problems with vanishing gradients during the training phase. \vspace{1mm}

For training deep networks, \textit{loss} functions are used for measuring how well the network performs to solve the task of interest. In classification tasks, the cross-entropy loss is commonly used where the predicted class scores $\hat{\vy}$ are compared against the true target class $\vy$,
\begin{align}
	\gL_{CE}(\vy, \hat{\vy}) = -\sum_{k=1}^{K} \vy[k] \log \hat{\vy}[k],
\end{align}
where the true target vector $\vy$ uses a one-hot representation where the true class $i$ is denoted in the vector by setting the $i$-th element in $\vy$ to one, as in $\vy[i] = 1$, and zero elsewhere.

 

Now when we know more about different variants of deep networks, we need to describe how to update the parameters during training to make accurate predictions.  

In order to train 

Training the networks is performed with an algorithm called \textit{backpropagation}. 



% For handling sequential data, we need to take into account that data on previous points in time may have an effect on future outcomes.

%The tasks of interest involves estimating some probability distribution from data. In classification tasks, we are given pairs $(\vx, \vy)$ of data with an associated target label and are asked to assign one of $k$ categories to input $\vx$. Hence, our goal is to estimate the conditional probability distribution $p(\vy | \vx)$ over the target label $\vy$ given the input data $\vx$. Commonly, the distribution $p_{\vtheta}(\vy | \vx)$ is parameterized by $\vtheta$. One can also write $p_{\vtheta}(\vy | \vx)$ as a function $f_{\vtheta}(\vx): \sR \rightarrow \{1, \dots, k\}$, such that $f_{\vtheta}(\vx) = p_{\vtheta}(\vy | \vx)$, where $f$ is a function that predicts target labels $\vy$ from inputs $\vx$ by performing a mapping between the input and target spaces. Our goal is to update the parameters $\vtheta$ such that they a loss function $\gL(\vtheta)$ is minimized. A typical loss for classification tasks is the cross-entropy loss which can be minimized by taking the gradient of $\gL$ w.r.t. the parameters $\vtheta$. 


%\MK{TO-DO: How to describe computing the loss and updating the parameters? Maybe the stanford CNN course has some nice explanations?}




%The goal with this thesis is to provide machine learning methods for recognizing objects from images. Machine learning is a field within Artificial Intelligence where computer programs learns from experiences how to make predictions in new situations. There are three essential parts to enable the computer to make predictions with machine learning. Firstly, we need data representing the scenarios where we have objects that we wish to predict what they are. Secondly, we need a model that learns how to make the decisions based on the provided data. Thirdly, we need a learning algorithm for fitting the model to the data we have such that good and sensible decisions can be made on future data. Machine learning has proven to be successful on various types of data, including, images and video, text, and audio, and there exists many different kinds of models and algorithms for learning decision-making from data. 

%One of the main goals with machine learning is to have models that generalize to unseen data and events. However, there are several challenges that has to be tackled to achieve this goal. The first challenge is to obtain datasets that represent the events that the model should make predictions for. Machine learning models often require vast amounts of examples to learn from, and also, the examples should be annotated with some information describing each example in order to ease the learning. But even if we have large datasets, we must have models that have the capacity of preserving the knowledge gained from the dataset. Furthermore, we must have algorithms that can train the model from the huge amount of data in computationally efficient both time- and processing-wise. Especially for visual data, it has become much cheaper to obtain vast amounts of images and videos from the internet. Occasionally, these can be annotated through search words or, alternatively, from crowdsourcing. Moreover, computational power has also become cheaper through smaller and more efficient micro-processors, semi-conductors, and cloud computing. Deep learning~\cite{goodfellow2016deep} is a class of machine learning models based on neural networks that are capable of learning from large and high-dimensional datasets due to their capacity. They are trained using an optimization algorithm called Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)~\cite{bottou2010large} which works well for large-scale data and can be applied on graphical processing units (GPUs) with recent machine learning programming libraries, such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Jax. However, deep learning still faces lots of challenges in generalization, especially when they are applied in environments that were not present in the training data, and it is still an open research problem on how to make them generalize better. 

%There are several approaches for enabling better generalization for deep learning models. A good start is to collect datasets that are similar and represent the events in the environment where the model will be deployed. Related to this, one can also collect different data types from various modalities, such as visual signals in the form of images and video as well as natural language which can be written or spoken, if these are available in the data collection process and are sensible for the task to be solved. Multimodal machine learning opens up the possibility of learning correspondences between the different data types to gain better understanding of the phenomenon of interest~\cite{baltruvsaitis2018multimodal, xu2013survey}, which can help the model to be more accurate and robust. However, in order to enhance the utility of machine learning models, they should be capable of continuously updating their knowledge as many environments where object recognition is useful are ever-changing~\cite{delange2021continual, parisi2019continual}. We should build models that can add new objects of interest to recognize as well as delete concepts that are obsolete or non-relevant. It would also be useful if we could update models with personalized objects to recognize to narrow down the scope of items to recognize for object recognizers to make the tasks easier.  

%In this chapter, we cover related works on datasets on object recognition both with image and text data in Section \ref{sec:datasets_for_object_recognition}. Next, we provide a description of machine learning, especially deep learning, models that were used in the included papers in Section \ref{sec:machine_learning} and \ref{sec:deep_learning}. In Section \ref{sec:continual_learning}, we discuss the setting of continual learning for updating the knowledge of machine learning models that is aiming to make the models capable of handling ever-changing environments as a step towards to enabling life-long learning.
