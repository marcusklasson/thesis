\noindent Scheduling over which tasks to select for replay at different times have been demonstrated to be important in continual learning. However, a replay scheduling policy that can be applied in any continual learning scenario is currently missing, which makes replay scheduling infeasible in real-world scenarios. To this end, we propose using reinforcement learning to enable learning policies that can be applied in new continual learning scenarios without additional computational cost. In our experiments, we show that the learned policies can propose replay schedules that efficiently mitigate catastrophic forgetting in environments with previously unseen task orders and datasets. The proposed approach opens up for new research directions in replay-based continual learning that stems well with real-world needs.
