  \caption{ Comparison of test classification accuracies for tasks 1-5 on Split FashionMNIST from using the replay schedules from the DQN and the Heuristic Global Drop (Heur-GD) scheduling baseline from 1 seed. We visualize the corresponding replay schedule used by both methods as a bubble plots. The DQN schedule yields better overall performance over Heur-AT due to the flexibility in which tasks to replay in the learned policy.
