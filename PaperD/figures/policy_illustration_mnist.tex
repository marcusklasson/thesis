  \caption{ Comparison of test classification accuracies for tasks 1-5 on Split MNIST from using the replay schedules from the DQN and the Heuristic Local Drop (Heur-LD) scheduling baseline from 1 seed. We visualize the corresponding replay schedule used by both methods as a bubble plots. The learned policy (DQN) remembers tasks 1 and 2 better than when replaying based on this heuristic.
