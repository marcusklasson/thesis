  \caption{ Comparison of test classification accuracies for tasks 1-5 on Split CIFAR-10 from using the replay schedules from the DQN and the Heuristic Accuracy Threshold (Heur-AT) scheduling baseline from 1 seed. We visualize the corresponding replay schedule used by both methods as a bubble plots. The DQN schedule yields better overall performance over Heur-AT due to the flexibility in which tasks to replay in the learned policy.
