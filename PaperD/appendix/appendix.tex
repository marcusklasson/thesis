\section*{Supplementary Material}

This supplementary material is structured as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Appendix \ref{paperD:app:methodology}: Details on the methodology, such as construction of the action space and the training procedure of the policy with RL.
    
    \item Appendix \ref{paperD:app:experimental_settings}: Details of the experimental settings on the CL and RL parts with hyperparameter settings for CL networks and the RL algorithms.  Moreover, we provide details on the heuristic scheduling baselines used in the experiments, as well as the ranking method used for assessing generalization capability. 
    
    \item Appendix \ref{paperD:app:additional_experimental_results}: Additional experimental results with tables showing performance metrics and ranks in every test environment, tables with Welch's $t$-test for each method, as well as figures showing the progress of ACC for the RL algorithms in the test environments.  
\end{itemize}
