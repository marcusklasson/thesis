This chapter introduces the idea of replay scheduling for mitigating catastrophic forgetting in continual learning. Replay scheduling involves selecting which tasks to fetch examples from and add to a replay memory at different times. The replay memory is then mixed with a batch of examples from the current task to learn to help the network to remember the previously learned tasks selected by the scheduler.
